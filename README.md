# FSJS - Unit 6 Project: Portfolio Site

Welcome to my portfolio site! 

This is the first of many iterations to come. In this current version, I utilized Node.js, Express, and Pug.js to create a fully functional portfolio site that also renders error pages when a user enters an invalid path to the website.
